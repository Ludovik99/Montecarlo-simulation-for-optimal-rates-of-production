# Montecarlo-simulation-for-optimal-rates-of-production

Predicting a flower grower's optimal rates of production with @RISK.

This project adapts Prescriptive Analytics techniques to predict the optimal production of flowers for a flower grower's company, given different scenarios on demand and price levels. The use of the @RISK plugin in Excel allowed us to conduct a Monte Carlo simulation and define optimal rates and probabilities for break-even values, allowing to incorporate risk into the supply-chain planning decisions.
